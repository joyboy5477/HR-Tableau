# HR Analytics Dashboard Project

This project aims to provide HR managers with data-driven insights for better decision-making. By utilizing tools like Python, Excel, SQL, and Tableau, we analyze employee data, including attrition rates, departmental distribution, age groups, job satisfaction, and education field-wise attrition. The interactive Tableau dashboard offers valuable insights into HR strategies.
